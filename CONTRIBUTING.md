# How to contribute\
\
This program may very well help a lot of people on their learning experience, for this reason 
here are some guidelines that contributors should follow so that we can have a chance of keeping on top of things.
\
## Getting Started\
\
* Make sure you have a [GitHub account](https://github.com/signup/free).\
* Submit a  ticket for your issue if one does not already exist.\
  * Clearly describe the issue including steps to reproduce when it is a bug.\
* Fork the repository on GitHub.\
\
## Making Changes\
\
* Create a topic branch from where you want to base your work.\
  * This is usually the master branch.\
  * Only target release branches if you are certain your fix must be on that\
    branch.\
  * To quickly create a topic branch based on master, run `git checkout -b\
    fix/master/my_contribution master`. Please avoid working directly on the\
    `master` branch.\
* Make commits of logical and atomic units.\
\

## Submitting Changes\
\
* Push your changes to a topic branch in your fork of the repository.\
* Submit a pull request to the repository \
